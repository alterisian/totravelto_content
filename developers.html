  Currently, we're looking for:
  <ul>
    <li>Remote Ruby developers working between UK,CEST and IST timezones (3+ hours per week)</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Collaborative Remote Ruby Developer For Sustainability Startup</h2>
<p>
  üöÑ Ruby, Ruby, Rubyyy! 
  We've all heard that song, but our rendition harmonizes Ruby with Rails, 
  crafting a symphony of code that sings with innovation. 
  Imagine your Ruby skills celebrated in a place where every line of code 
  makes a difference to the world? üé∂
</p>
<p>
  üõ§ We‚Äôre expanding our band to include two key players:
  <ul>
    <li>a Front-End developer with Stimulus and JavaScript mastery, and </li>
    <li>a back-end specialist, who aspires to TDD with RSpec. </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>Collaborate directly with Ian, our technical founder, extensive development experience through pair or mob programming. 
    Together, we‚Äôre not just coding; we‚Äôre revolutionizing long-distance train journey planning with Generative AI, 
    making it smoother and more accessible. üåê
</p>

<p>
  üå± Join us for a unique volunteering opportunity. 
  With a commitment of about 3 hours weekly, 
  you‚Äôll help cut CO2 emissions by 35kg per hour contributed, 
  earning a certificate for your vital environmental contributions. 
  As part of our close-knit team of 8, you'll have a rare chance for growth and to make an impactful difference. 
  We are an international and distributed team, across multiple timezones between UK, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Philapines and India.
  We primarily are looking for people who can default to collaboration i.e. pair/mob on these timezones at this stage. We believe this to be the best practise for delivering good product outcomes. If you're pure async in approach, then sorry, but this will not be for you.
  Dive into a project where passion meets purpose, blending technology with sustainability. üåç
</p>

<p>
  As we gain traction, we would look to our volunteer contributors for paid positions first.
